FaceRecognition is an implementation project of face detection and  recognition. The face detection using MTCNN algorithm, and recognition using LightenedCNN algorithm. 

* MTCNN is a deep cascaded multi-task framework to boost up face detection performance. See also [OAID/mtcnn](https://github.com/OAID/mtcnn).
* Lightened CNN is a light CNN framework to learn a compact embedding on the large-scale face data with massive noisy labels. See also [LightenedCNN](https://github.com/AlfredXiangWu/face_verification_experiment).

The release version is 0.1.1, is based on [Rockchip RK3399](http://www.rock-chips.com/plus/3399.html) Platform, target OS is Ubuntu 16.04.
