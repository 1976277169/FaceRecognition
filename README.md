# FaceRecognition
[![GitHub license](http://dmlc.github.io/img/apache2.svg)](./LICENSE)

FaceRecognition is an implementation project of face detection and  recognition. The face detection using MTCNN algorithm, and recognition using LightenedCNN algorithm. 

The release version is 0.1.2, is based on Rock960 Platform, target OS is Ubuntu 16.04.

* MTCNN is a deep cascaded multi-task framework to boost up face detection performance. See also [OAID/mtcnn](https://github.com/OAID/mtcnn).
* Lightened CNN is a light CNN framework to learn a compact embedding on the large-scale face data with massive noisy labels. See also [LightenedCNN](https://github.com/AlfredXiangWu/face_verification_experiment).
